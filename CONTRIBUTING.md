## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to be respectful and constructive. Please ensure that your interactions with the community are positive and inclusive.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

DAIV Sandbox uses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting:

- **Linting**: `make lint-check`
- **Formatting**: `make lint-format`
- **Linting and formatting**: `make lint`
- **Fix linting and formatting issues**: `make lint-fix`

Our code formatting configuration includes:

- Line length: 120 characters
- Target Python version: 3.12
- isort configuration for import sorting

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all linting checks:

```bash
make lint
```

### Testing

DAIV Sandbox uses pytest for testing:

1. **Run all tests**:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

2. **Writing tests**:

   - Tests should be placed in the `tests/` directory.
   - Test file names should start with `test_` and follow the same directory structure as the source code.
   - Test classes should follow the pattern `Test*` or `*Test`.
   - Use pytest fixtures for test setup/teardown.

3. **Coverage**:
   - The test suite reports coverage using the pytest-cov plugin.
   - Aim for high test coverage with meaningful tests.

### Type Checking

We use mypy for static type checking but we don't enforce it, we encourage you to use it to improve your code quality:

```bash
make lint-typing
```

## Making Contributions

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that reflect the purpose of your changes:

- `feat/description` for new features
- `fix/description` for bug fixes
- `chore/description` for chores
- `security/description` for security fixes

### Commit Messages

Write clear and concise commit messages that explain what changes were made and why. Follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests where appropriate

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Ensure code quality** by running `make lint`

4. **Update documentation** if necessary
5. **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch
